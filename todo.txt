- Get a tensorflow version working
- Test again
- Next course
- Get some real data from Cam

Notes from Course 3
- Use a single evaluation metric
- Look at misclassified examples
- Use static training and dev sets

Backlog
- Use cloud service or Jetson Nano for GPU (need TF and deep NN)
- Have true source wav files based on downsampling
    - Is it necessary if all tests are downsampled and compared to each other?
