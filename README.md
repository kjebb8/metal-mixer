# Purpose
Deep learning project for music separation into source instruments. The final goal is to separate a given piece of music by instrument, then give the listener control over the volume of each instrument. One potential use is to isolate the drum part of a complex metal song (hence the name) for learning or general appreciation.

# Components
The project consists of four parts:
1. Data Handling for managing training data and preprocessing
2. Machine Learning for the separation algorithm (implements only a simple feed-forward neural network at this time)
3. Spectrogram for generating spectrograms from audio
4. Music Separation for applying separation techniques to multi-instrument spectrograms

# How it Works
1. Training data is generated by mixing audio of two different instruments and dividing into small time segments
2. For each training example, an ideal binary mask is generated for each instrument such that when applied to the combined spectrogram, it returns the spectrum of only one instrument
3. A neural network is trained to predict a separation mask using the ideal mask from #2 as the truth data
4. The mask can be applied to mixed audio to recover the audio of specific instruments

# Implementation
The project is written in Python with numpy. The ML components are coded with numpy as well to gain an understanding of common deep learning algorithms.
